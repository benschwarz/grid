# Grid

A super simple grid system that: 

* Doesn't use floats
* Does use border-box
* Doesn't work in IE before 8
* Is tiny, simple, and therefore nice to use

Check the [demo](http://benschwarz.github.com/grid/index.html). Grab [grid.min.css](https://raw.github.com/benschwarz/grid/master/grid.min.css), or if you prefer â€” [grid.scss](https://raw.github.com/benschwarz/grid/master/grid.scss).

## Contributing / building from this repository

Grid uses [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) to build, but its also currently just an alias to building on the command line. Use `grunt watch` to have the CSS build as you work, then ensure that everything looks a-okay in `index.html`. Pull requests should contain screenshots or as much information to explain the change as possible.
